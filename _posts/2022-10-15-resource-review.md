# black hills infosec rocks

## time and money meet mouth

A quick post reviewing John Strand's Black Hills information security community
resource project. His time is valuable but he invests it and other resources to
further his goals of making the expensive and often opaque process of
establishing a career in information technology and information security more
accessible.

## pay what you can training, evergreen labs, fun?

The pay what you can format exists around the web but not for training to this
extent and of this value. Sessions of high quality span from intro to advanced
with fees to fit every budget. Training sessions last several days with
practical expert instruction featuring evergreen labs constantly updated for
value and relevance. Most classes also include an ask me anything session and
access to a highly engaged discord channel for during and after support. The
team at BHIS has even taken steps to provide alternating schedules with friendly
time zones for those in the EU and MENA. These fun sessions kept me engaged in
the material as time flew by. I thoroughly enjoyed them and will continue to
support and recommend black hills offerings.

## appointment YouTube

The BHIS YouTube channel provides invaluable resources for staying up to date
with security and technology news with their "talking bout security" regular
updates you can also find byte sized tutorials featuring guest speakers.
