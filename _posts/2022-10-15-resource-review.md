# black hills infosec rocks

## time and money meet mouth

This is a quick post reviewing John Strand's Black Hills information security
community resource project. His time is obviously valuable but he is investing
it and other resources to further his goals of making the historically expensive
and often opaque process of establishing a career in information technology and
security more accessible.

## pay what you can training, evergreen labs, fun?

Just a few standout points about their offerings are the pay what you can
training sessions which provide access to high quality intro and advanced
training subjects with fees from 0 dollars for those with a self-identified need
or a few hundred dollars for anyone more established. These training sessions
are multi-day with practical expert instruction featuring evergreen labs that
are constantly updated for value and relevance. Most classes also include an ask
me anything session and access to a highly engaged discord channel for during
and after support. The team at BHIS has even taken steps to provide alternating
schedules that are time zone friendly for those in the EU and MENA. Lastly these
sessions were above all fun, which is far from the norm as I can attest to. I
thoroughly enjoyed them and will continue to support and recommend black hills
offerings.

the BHIS youtube channel is also an invaluable resource for staying up to date
with security and technology news, you can also find byte sized tutorials and
guests speakers series.
