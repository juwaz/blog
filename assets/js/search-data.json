            "content": "Stacking: Learning Multiple Things at One Time . Have you ever wondered how some people seem to master multiple skills in a short amount of time? How do they manage to juggle different topics and projects without getting overwhelmed or confused? The answer is simple: they use a technique called stacking. . Stacking is the practice of learning multiple things at one time, by combining them in a way that makes sense and enhances your learning experience. For example, you could learn a new language while also learning how to code, or you could learn how to play an instrument while also learning about music theory. The possibilities are endless! . wait but why . But why would you want to do that? Isn’t it better to focus on one thing at a time and master it before moving on to the next? Well, not necessarily. Here are some benefits of stacking that might surprise you: . It boosts your motivation and engagement. Learning multiple things at once can make your learning journey more fun and exciting, as you get to explore different aspects of your interests and passions. You can also avoid boredom and burnout by switching between different topics and activities, keeping your mind fresh and curious 1. | It improves your memory and retention. Learning multiple things at once can help you create connections and associations between different concepts and ideas, which can enhance your understanding and recall. You can also use the spacing effect, which is the phenomenon that information is better remembered when it is repeated over spaced intervals, rather than in a single session. By revisiting different topics and skills over time, you can reinforce your learning and prevent forgetting. | It develops your creativity and problem-solving skills. Learning multiple things at once can stimulate your brain and challenge you to think outside the box. You can also use the transfer effect, which is the phenomenon that learning one skill can improve your performance in another related skill. By applying what you learn from one domain to another, you can discover new insights and solutions that you might not have otherwise 2. | It prepares you for the real world. Learning multiple things at once can help you adapt to the changing and complex world we live in, where you need to be able to learn new things quickly and effectively. You can also use the interleaving effect, which is the phenomenon that mixing different types of tasks and topics can improve your learning and performance. By exposing yourself to different scenarios and situations, you can become more flexible and versatile. | . teach me how to stack . As you can see, stacking can be a powerful and rewarding way to learn multiple things at one time. But how do you do it effectively? Here are some tips to help you get started: . Choose topics and skills that are related or complementary. This will help you create meaningful connections and associations between them, and avoid confusion and interference. For example, you could learn a new language that shares the same alphabet or grammar as your native language, or you could learn how to code in a language that is relevant to your field or industry. | Plan your learning schedule and goals. This will help you organize your time and resources, and track your progress and achievements. For example, you could set a specific amount of time or number of sessions per week for each topic or skill, or you could set a specific outcome or project that you want to complete by the end of a certain period. | Use different methods and resources. This will help you diversify your learning experience and cater to your preferences and needs. For example, you could use books, videos, podcasts, online courses, apps, games, quizzes, flashcards, etc. to learn different topics and skills, or you could use different modes of learning, such as reading, writing, listening, speaking, etc. | Review and reflect on your learning. This will help you consolidate your learning and identify your strengths and weaknesses. For example, you could use a journal, a blog, a portfolio, etc. to document your learning journey and share your thoughts and feelings, or you could use feedback, tests, quizzes, etc. to assess your learning outcomes and performance. | . This article is itself a work of stacking as I experimented with prompt engineering to draft and proofread this post as well as translate it into my language of study: spanish. Please keep in mind that the following translation may not be completely accurate or idiomatic and it’s main purpose is to help me learn/practice the language. . Apilamiento: Aprender varias cosas a la vez . ¿Alguna vez te has preguntado cómo algunas personas parecen dominar varias habilidades en poco tiempo? ¿Cómo hacen para manejar diferentes temas y proyectos sin agobiarse o confundirse? La respuesta es simple: utilizan una técnica llamada apilamiento. . El apilamiento es la práctica de aprender varias cosas a la vez, combinándolas de una manera que tenga sentido y mejore tu experiencia de aprendizaje. Por ejemplo, podrías aprender un nuevo idioma mientras también aprendes a programar, o podrías aprender a tocar un instrumento mientras también aprendes sobre teoría musical. ¡Las posibilidades son infinitas! . espera pero por qué .

            "content": "bring me the head of your authentication portal . . bug bounty primer . For those unfamiliar with the term, bug bounties are programs that security conscious organizations offer for “White Hat” hackers to review their technology systems for vulnerabilities and engage in responsible disclosures in exchange for compensation and recognition. Historically security researchers complain that most companies don’t have a well structured or maintained program and seemingly work against the white hat hacker at every turn. . luhn’s primer . def luhn(n): r = [int(ch) for ch in str(n)][::-1] return (sum(r[0::2]) + sum(sum(divmod(d*2,10)) for d in r[1::2])) % 10 == 0 . Hans Peter Luhn’s algorithm also known as the MOD 10 is the go to checksum for validating identification numbers found most notably in credit card processing 1 but also appearing in a range of identification numbers from telephony to social security. . the find . During an online hackathon I discovered that a major billing processor had an issue with one of their portals processing the luhn’s credit card number validations in a snippet of their client side code (readily accessible to any end user of the web app). This interaction with the portal could be fuzzed (substituting random input values until a new or desired output returns). This portal lacked rate limitations, robot validations, or malicious IP address filtering. This in combination with another hosted portal where ordinary users could retrieve the first six and last four of their credit card (for convenience purposes) meant that the billing company essentially provided the hash and payload of customer credit cards (the nature of luhn’s algorithm) as well as an open and unlimited portal to test them. . antics ensue . After documenting the issue and reaching out to the billing company requesting a responsible disclosure/bug bounty path I met with hardships at every turn. First I didn’t hear anything for weeks and when I re-engaged them for a follow-up I received a curt response that the issue was out of scope for their program which targeted exploitation of a specific resource rather than compromising users by combining disparate portals. I responded that this out of the box approach to extracting sensitive information mirrors how a “black hat” would approach attacking their system/users and that their scope should expand accordingly. Once again I heard nothing initially but found an offer for company “Swag” buried in my email weeks later. I declined as I had no interest in promoting the company and intended to pursue other avenues to submit/appeal the bounty (sometimes soliciting intervention from an established bug bounty company like hackerone can lead to improved outcomes for the white hat). Soon after their last contact offering “Swag” I noticed that both the client side Luhn’s vulnerability and the convenience portals updated to feature rate limits and optical character recognition prompts to deter malicious prompts/inputs. . that’s all folks . To recap the billing company stalled throughout the process, defined scope in a way that benefited them and offered pennies for a vulnerability that was certainly worth dollars to a black hat or in the wild. From what I can tell this behavior encompasses the rule not the exception when it comes to most bug bounty programs. In short the incentives between the organization and the hacker are not aligned and even in the best run programs the white hats are under appreciated. Regardless I have no regrets and found the process of finding and attempting to responsibly disclose the bug bounty a fun and rewarding experience. . . footnote . source: https://www.creditcardvalidator.org/articles/luhn-algorithm &#8617; . |",

Today I’ll be reviewing Jeremy Howard’s deep learning for coders resource project as well as the topic of Artificial Intelligence broadly. . ai curious . Artificial Intelligence has piqued my interest of late as it’s beginning to play a meaningful role in various fields including those most familiar to me, information security and DevOps.

I found them to be approachable even for those with zero deep learning experience, well-organized, and with a perfect balance of theory, practice, and real-world applications.

Experts agree with some remarking that we could be “summoning the beast”. At the moment artificial intelligence applications and resources over-index on novelty and value but what happens when eventual misuses of the technology and research causes society to question the source and veracity of text and digital media as well as the criterium used by neural networks that play a key role in the decision making process for various technical applications.
