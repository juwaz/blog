            "content": "bring me the head of your authentication portal . . bug bounty primer . For those unfamiliar with the term, bug bounties are programs that security conscious organizations offer for ‚ÄúWhite Hat‚Äù hackers to review their technology systems for vulnerabilities and engage in responsible disclosures in exchange for compensation and recognition. Historically security researchers complain that most companies don‚Äôt have a well structured or maintained program and seemingly work against the white hat hacker at every turn. . luhn‚Äôs primer . def luhn(n): r = [int(ch) for ch in str(n)][::-1] return (sum(r[0::2]) + sum(sum(divmod(d*2,10)) for d in r[1::2])) % 10 == 0 . Hans Peter Luhn‚Äôs algorithm also known as the MOD 10 is the go to checksum for validating identification numbers found most notably in credit card processing 1 but also appearing in a range of identification numbers from telephony to social security. . the find . During an online hackathon I discovered that a major billing processor had an issue with one of their portals processing the luhn‚Äôs credit card number validations in a snippet of their client side code (readily accessible to any end user of the web app). This interaction with the portal could be fuzzed (substituting random input values until a new or desired output returns). This portal lacked rate limitations, robot validations, or malicious IP address filtering. This in combination with another hosted portal where ordinary users could retrieve the first six and last four of their credit card (for convenience purposes) meant that the billing company essentially provided the hash and payload of customer credit cards (the nature of luhn‚Äôs algorithm) as well as an open and unlimited portal to test them. . antics ensue . After documenting the issue and reaching out to the billing company requesting a responsible disclosure/bug bounty path I met with hardships at every turn. First I didn‚Äôt hear anything for weeks and when I re-engaged them for a follow-up I received a curt response that the issue was out of scope for their program which targeted exploitation of a specific resource rather than compromising users by combining disparate portals. I responded that this out of the box approach to extracting sensitive information mirrors how a ‚Äúblack hat‚Äù would approach attacking their system/users and that their scope should expand accordingly. Once again I heard nothing initially but found an offer for company ‚ÄúSwag‚Äù buried in my email weeks later. I declined as I had no interest in promoting the company and intended to pursue other avenues to submit/appeal the bounty (sometimes soliciting intervention from an established bug bounty company like hackerone can lead to improved outcomes for the white hat). Soon after their last contact offering ‚ÄúSwag‚Äù I noticed that both the client side Luhn‚Äôs vulnerability and the convenience portals updated to feature rate limits and optical character recognition prompts to deter malicious prompts/inputs. . that‚Äôs all folks . To recap the billing company stalled throughout the process, defined scope in a way that benefited them and offered pennies for a vulnerability that was certainly worth dollars to a black hat or in the wild. From what I can tell this behavior encompasses the rule not the exception when it comes to most bug bounty programs. In short the incentives between the organization and the hacker are not aligned and even in the best run programs the white hats are under appreciated. Regardless I have no regrets and found the process of finding and attempting to responsibly disclose the bug bounty a fun and rewarding experience. . . footnote . source: https://www.creditcardvalidator.org/articles/luhn-algorithm¬†&#8617; . |",

Today I‚Äôll be reviewing Jeremy Howard‚Äôs deep learning for coders resource project as well as the topic of Artificial Intelligence broadly. . ai curious . Artificial Intelligence has piqued my interest of late as it‚Äôs beginning to play a meaningful role in various fields including those most familiar to me, information security and DevOps.

I found them to be approachable even for those with zero deep learning experience, well-organized, and with a perfect balance of theory, practice, and real-world applications.

At the moment artificial intelligence applications and resources over-index on novelty and value but what happens when eventual misuses of the technology and research causes society to question the source and veracity of text and digital media as well as the criterium used by neural networks that play a key role in the decision making process for various technical applications.
